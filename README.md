### build library (C++-part)

In all of my repositories you will find a `build.sh`. You only have to run this script. It doesn't required sudo, because you have to install required tool via apt, for example, by yourself. But if other projects from me are required, it download them from github and build them in the correct version too. This script is also use by the ci-pipeline, so its tested with every commit.


Run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/kitsudaiki/libKitsumiAiSdk.git
cd libKitsumiAiSdk/cpp
./build.sh
cd ../result
```

It create automatic a `build` and `result` directory in the directory, where you have cloned the project. At first it build all into the `build`-directory and after all build-steps are finished, it copy the include directory from the cloned repository and the build library into the `result`-directory. So you have all in one single place.

Tested on Debian and Ubuntu. If you use Centos, Arch, etc and the build-script fails on your machine, then please write me a mail and I will try to fix the script.
